# SQL_PROJECT_AtliQ_Sales_Analytics


## The Objective is to develop queries that analyze and identify the top customers, products, and markets for a given business. The project involves querying a database containing transactional data to derive insights that can inform strategic decision-making and improve business performance.
### - Top Cusstomers

### addition to the SQL queries and report creation, optimizing performance is crucial for handling large datasets efficiently and ensuring that queries execute quickly. 
### -- Performance Improvement # 1

### -- creating dim_date and joining with this table and avoid using the function 'get_fiscal_year()' to reduce the amount of time taking to run the query
	SELECT 
    	    s.date, 
            s.customer_code,
            s.product_code, 
            p.product, p.variant, 
            s.sold_quantity, 
            g.gross_price as gross_price_per_item,
            ROUND(s.sold_quantity*g.gross_price,2) as gross_price_total,
            pre.pre_invoice_discount_pct
	FROM fact_sales_monthly s
	JOIN dim_date dt
        	ON dt.calendar_date = s.date
	JOIN dim_product p
        	ON s.product_code=p.product_code
	JOIN fact_gross_price g

    		pre.fiscal_year=dt.fiscal_year
	WHERE 
    		dt.fiscal_year=2021     
	LIMIT 1500000;

### Performance Improvement # 2

### -- Added the fiscal year in the fact_sales_monthly table itself
	SELECT 
    	    s.date, 
            s.customer_code,
            s.product_code, 
            p.product, p.variant, 
            s.sold_quantity, 
            g.gross_price as gross_price_per_item,
            ROUND(s.sold_quantity*g.gross_price,2) as gross_price_total,
            pre.pre_invoice_discount_pct

### Module: Database Views: Introduction

-- Get the net_invoice_sales amount using the CTE's
	WITH cte1 AS (
		SELECT 
    		    s.date, 
    		    s.customer_code,
    		    s.product_code, 
                    p.product, p.variant, 
                    s.sold_quantity, 
                    g.gross_price as gross_price_per_item,
                    ROUND(s.sold_quantity*g.gross_price,2) as gross_price_total,
                    pre.pre_invoice_discount_pct
		FROM fact_sales_monthly s
		JOIN dim_product p
        		ON s.product_code=p.product_code
		JOIN fact_gross_price g
    			ON g.fiscal_year=s.fiscal_year
    			AND g.product_code=s.product_code
		JOIN fact_pre_invoice_deductions as pre
        		ON pre.customer_code = s.customer_code AND
    			pre.fiscal_year=s.fiscal_year
		WHERE 
    			s.fiscal_year=2021) 
	SELECT 
      	    *, 
    	    (gross_price_total-pre_invoice_discount_pct*gross_price_total) as net_invoice_sales
	FROM cte1
	LIMIT 1500000;


-- Creating the view `sales_preinv_discount` and store all the data in like a virtual table
	CREATE  VIEW `sales_preinv_discount` AS
	SELECT 
    	    s.date, 
            s.fiscal_year,
            s.customer_code,
            c.market,
            s.product_code, 
            p.product, 
            p.variant, 
            s.sold_quantity, 
            g.gross_price as gross_price_per_item,
            ROUND(s.sold_quantity*g.gross_price,2) as gross_price_total,

	JOIN fact_pre_invoice_deductions as pre
        	ON pre.customer_code = s.customer_code AND
    		pre.fiscal_year=s.fiscal_year

### -- Now generate net_invoice_sales using the above created view "sales_preinv_discount"
	SELECT 
            *,
    	    (gross_price_total-pre_invoice_discount_pct*gross_price_total) as net_invoice_sales
	FROM gdb0041.sales_preinv_discount







### Creating views can be a beneficial approach to simplify complex queries, encapsulate frequently used logic, and enhance query performance. Here's how you can incorporate views into the SQL Project:
### Database Views: Post Invoice Discount, Net Sales

### -- Create a view for post invoice deductions: `sales_post_inv_discount`
	CREATE VIEW `sales_post_inv_discount` AS
	SELECT 
    	    s.date, s.fiscal_year,
            s.customer_code, s.market,
            s.product_code, s.product, s.variant,
            s.sold_quantity, s.gross_price_total,
            s.pre_invoice_discount_pct,
            (s.gross_price_total-s.pre_invoice_discount_pct*s.gross_price_total) as net_invoice_sales,
            (po.discounts_pct+po.other_deductions_pct) as post_invoice_discount_pct
	FROM sales_preinv_discount s
	JOIN fact_post_invoice_deductions po
		ON po.customer_code = s.customer_code AND
   		po.product_code = s.product_code AND
   		po.date = s.date;

### -- Create a report for net sales
	SELECT 
            *, 
    	    net_invoice_sales*(1-post_invoice_discount_pct) as net_sales
	FROM gdb0041.sales_postinv_discount;

### -- Finally creating the view `net_sales` which inbuiltly use/include all the previous created view and gives the final result
	CREATE VIEW `net_sales` AS
	SELECT 
            *, 
    	    net_invoice_sales*(1-post_invoice_discount_pct) as net_sales
	FROM gdb0041.sales_postinv_discount;






### Top Markets and Customers 

### -- Get top 5 market by net sales in fiscal year 2021
	SELECT 
    	    market, 
            round(sum(net_sales)/1000000,2) as net_sales_mln
	FROM gdb0041.net_sales
	where fiscal_year=2021
	group by market
	order by net_sales_mln desc
	limit 5

-- Stored proc to get top n markets by net sales for a given year
	CREATE PROCEDURE `get_top_n_markets_by_net_sales`(
        	in_fiscal_year INT,
    		in_top_n INT
	)
	BEGIN
        	SELECT 
                     market, 
                     round(sum(net_sales)/1000000,2) as net_sales_mln
        	FROM net_sales
        	where fiscal_year=in_fiscal_year
        	group by market
        	order by net_sales_mln desc
        	limit in_top_n;
	END

-- stored procedure that takes market, fiscal_year and top n as an input and returns top n customers by net sales in that given fiscal year and market
	CREATE PROCEDURE `get_top_n_customers_by_net_sales`(
        	in_market VARCHAR(45),
        	in_fiscal_year INT,
    		in_top_n INT
	)
	BEGIN
        	select 
                     customer, 
                     round(sum(net_sales)/1000000,2) as net_sales_mln
        	from net_sales s
        	join dim_customer c
                on s.customer_code=c.customer_code
        	where 
		    s.fiscal_year=in_fiscal_year 
		    and s.market=in_market
        	group by customer
        	order by net_sales_mln desc
        	limit in_top_n;
	END
